            <p>
                Tyler was born in Lima, Ohio. From there her and her family moved to Iowa where she began elementary school. 
                When Tyler was in the second grade she had a teacher that she really felt inspired by and from then on she wanted to become a teacher. 
                Before she began fifth grade her and her family moved to San Antonio, Texas. She moved to a few different places in that area, and ended up graduating high school from Floresville. 
                At this point she still wanted to be a teacher so she began taking classes at the local community college in San Antonio. 
                After one year of that she decided to move to Iowa and transferred to Des Moines Area Community college in Ankeny. 
                She did that for one year and  then moved on to the University of Iowa in Ames. She went there for three years and graduated with a degree in elementary education.

                While living on her own at DMACC she really began to enjoy cooking for herself and sometimes her roommate. 
                This is something that she still enjoys very much to this day. While going to Iowa state she met and began to date Ben. 
                When they started dating they started to go camping together. At first they did not know what they were doing, but they are now experts and love to hop in the car and go camp somewhere. 
                Ben loved to travel, so they went to New York City together and Tyler   picked up on the love for travel as well. At about the same time Tyler graduated Tyler and Ben got engaged. 
                They got married later that year.

                After college Tyler began job searching for a teaching position. She was unable to find a position the first year, so she began to substitute teach. 
                She did this for two years, until rather unexpectedly getting a job as a library technology teacher. 
                She managed an elementary school library, the schools technology, and taught students technology and library skills. 
                After a year of that she got a job as a first grade teacher, which she is still doing now.
