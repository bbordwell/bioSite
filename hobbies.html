                    <li>Cooking
                        <p>Tyler has always had a love for cooking. One thing that she likes about cooking is that it is very useful to everyday life. 
                            Unless you constantly want to go out for food, you have to cook anyway, so you might as well enjoy it. 
                            If you don’t have a lot of time to cook there are plenty of quick meals you can make, or if you have an entire day you can make an extravagant meal that will take all day to cook. 
                            Food also brings people together, so cooking is a good way to create social events. Tyler especially enjoys cooking when she is on a holiday break from school.

                    <li>Traveling
                        <p>
                            Traveling is another thing I have always enjoyed, but I really started to travel a lot when Ben and I took a trip to New York City when we were dating. 
                            Since then we have tried to take one big trip every year, and fit smaller trips in when we can. Tyler’s first international trip was to England. 
                            On that trip she spent most of her time in London, but also visited some family in the southeast of England by the sea. 
                            Tyler also took the train from London to Paris and fulfilled her lifelong dream of seeing the Eiffel tower. 
                            She later took a trip to Spain in which she split her time between Madrid and Barcelona. Tyler had nothing but great things to say about Madrid. 
                            More recently she took a road trip to Texas. Tyler spent time in San Antonio and also had some beach time at South Padre Island. 
                            She has also done some road trips to national parks.

                    <li>Camping
                        <p>
                            When Tyler started dating Ben they out of the blue decided to try camping. 
                            They went to a Wal-Mart and bought everything they thought they might need. 
                            They ended up having a hard time setting up the tent, cooking food over a fire, and they got cold at night. 
                            Tyler still enjoyed the experience and tried again, this time better prepared. 
                            Since then she has enjoyed car camping at different Iowa State Parks to tour the state. 
                            She took one big road trip through the southwest United States and camped in many different national parks including the Grand Canyon, Death Valley, and Canyonlands. 
                            Tyler has also done a little bit of backpacking, which is where you have to hike all of your supplies in with a backpack. 
                            She said that her experience backpacking at Yellow River State Forrest was especially memorable.
